# (c) MVdW Software            #
# ---------------------------- #

# Description: This MVdW Software design will allow
# you to sync your plugin config with other servers
# You have two types of configuration:
# - 1 Master configuration
# - 1 or more Slave configurations
#
# The master is the plugin/server that will be used
# as the main config.
# The slaves will USE (not copy) the config of the master
# When the master is offline, the slaves will use their own
# config (or the last fetched config).

# When enabled the configuration must be valid
enabled: false

# Define if the configuration of this server
# will be used as the master config.
master: false

# THESE SETTINGS ONLY APPLY IF THIS SERVER
# IS THE MASTER
master-config:
  # Port used to listen for slaves
  port: 7899
  # Password to identify the slaves (DO NOT USE SOMETHING YOU USE ELSEWHERE)
  password: 'Sowwyz3131'

# THESE SETTINGS ONLY APPLY IF THIS SERVER
# IS A SLAVE
slave-config:
  # Hostname or IP of the master
  hostname: 'localhost'
  # Port used by the master
  port: 7899
  # Password used by the master
  password: 'Sowwyz3131'
  # Sync interval IN MINUTES (you can force a sync using a command)
  interval: 5
