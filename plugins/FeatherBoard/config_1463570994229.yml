#
#  FeatherBoard 1.9.0
#  Runs like a feather on your server
#  (c) Maxim Van de Wynckel
#
# ------------------------------ #

# Permissions: To use the action groups give them the permission
#              featherboard.group.<group>
#              Make sure to remove them from the other groups
#              when giving a new permission.

# Variables: These variables can be used in the TEXT section
#            of both the header as the footer.
#            
#            {PLAYER}       - Player name
#            {PLAYERNICK}   - Player nickname
#            {SERVER}       - Server name
#            {PLAYERCOUNT}  - Server player count
#            {BUNGEECOUNT}  - Bungee network player count
#            850+ more ... see spigot page

# Formatting: These are formatting tags allowing you to format the animations
#             or placeholders.
#
#             Substring: This allows you to split a word (even a placeholder) in parts
#               example: <substring begin=0 end=3>Hello World</substring> = Hel
#               usage: This can be used to split placeholders when creating a typewriter
#                      or to split the colors in a placeholder.
#
#             Scroll: This creates a scrolling animation of the text inside it. It accepts
#                     two arguments (the length and space between scrolls).
#               example: <scroll width=20 spaces=20>&2This is a &atest</scroll>

# Tweaks to increase performance (Use at own risk)
tweaks:
  # This option does not send scoreboard remove packets
  # to the client on quit. This can increase performance on servers
  # where players quit a lot (hubs, ...)
  #
  # Removal of the plugin requires you to manually delete the scoreboard.dat in the worlds
  # /data folder
  #
  # Enabling this can cause the scoreboard not to work anymore. Use at your own risk
  keepScoreboardOnQuit: false
  

# Anti Flicker will use a new engine that will allow you to use fast animations
# without any flicker. This is an EXPERIMENTAL feature and it asked to post bugs
# and problems that only occur with this option enabled in a Spigot private message.
# Using this option shortens the maximum length for 1.8 servers to around 26~28 chars
# but this is an increase for 1.7 clients (that default only have 16 characters)
# IF YOU ARE HAVING PROBLEMS. TRY TO TURN THIS OFF FIRST
