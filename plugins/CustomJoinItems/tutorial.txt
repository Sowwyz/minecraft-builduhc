This file will only list ALL the possible nodes for each item, and the latest changelog.
The item below is an example.

item:


    id: 352
    # (REQUIRED) The ID of the material.
    
    
    name: '&aTest item'
    # (REQUIRED) The custom name of the item (with formatting codes).
    
    
    data-value: 0
    # This is optional. Can be used for colored wool, and other items with data values.
    
    
    command: 'say Hello world'
    # The command bound to this item. It will be executed when the item is right clicked.
    # Can be executed as OP, as the console, but also connect to a BungeeCord server or
    # just tell something to the player. Put one of this possible options before the
    # command to use them:
    #
    # command: 'console:say This command is executed from the console.'
    #
    # Valid options are:
    # 
    # 'console: '
    # 'op: '
    # 'server: ' (for BungeeCord)
    # 'tell: ' (sends a message to the player)
    #
    # You can use symbols, and the placeholders %player% and %world%.
    # Use multiple commands with a semicolon (;) e.g.: 'tell: This is; tell: a double command.'
