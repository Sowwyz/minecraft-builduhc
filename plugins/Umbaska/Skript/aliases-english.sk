
# ====== Aliases ======
# In this file you can create aliases. An alias is a name for a block or an item, or a collection of such.
# There are hundreds of predefined aliases, so you don't usually need to care about this file.
#
# An alias is nothing more than a mapping from a name to one or more item/block types.
# e.g: 'torch = 50' creates the alias 'torch' and maps it to 50, the ID of a torch.
# So now every time you need a torch you can write torch instead of 50, which is much more intuitive.
# You can make an alias match multiple types by separating them with a comma, e.g. 'water = 8, 9'.
# You can also include data values, e.g. 'orange wool = 35:1'. Data Values can be a range,
# e.g. 'wet farmland = 60:1-8' (60:0 is dry farmland)
#
# == Advanced ==
# As different languages have different ways of forming plurals of words you have to define the plurals of all aliases yourself.
# This is done by adding the plural ending after a ¦ character, e.g. 'log¦s = 17'.
# If the singular and plural have different endings each, use two ¦ characters, e.g. 'bookshel¦f¦ves = 47'.
# If you want to pluralize a word within the alias, use another ¦ character, e.g.. 'bucket¦¦s¦ of water' ('¦¦s¦' means: no singular ending, plural ending 's').
# These plurals are both used by Skript when displaying items, e.g. 2 logs will be displayed as '2 logs',
# while 1 log will be displayed as '1 log', but are also used when parsing, i.e. you can write '1 log' or '2 logs' and both is understood.
# Aliases should also have a gender, which can be defined by adding '@<gender>' after the alias, e.g. 'emerald¦s @an' ('@a' can be omitted as it's the default).
# - English genders are 'a' and 'an', and German genders are 'n', 'm', and 'f' (these are all defined in the respectile language file).
# All languages can use the special genders 'x' and '-' for plural and no gender respectively, e.g. 'leaves @x' or 'air @-'.
#
# Sometimes you want to make a part of an alias optional, e.g. in 'wooden door',
# which is also sometimes called 'wood door', the 'en' can be made optional.
# This can be done by putting the optional part into square brackets ([]):
# 	wood[en] door = 64 # creates 2 aliases: 'wood door = 64' and 'wooden door = 64'
#
# Some blocks/items have different names, like the slab which is also called step.
# In this case you can simple write something like this:
#	(step|slab) = 44            # creates two aliases, 'slab' and 'step', of which both are mapped to '44'
#	stone (step|slab) = 44:0    # creates 'stone slab' and 'stone step' mapped to '44:0'
#	wood[en] (step|slab) = 44:2 # creates four aliases
#
# Some blocks and items share some different appearances, e.g. wood, saplings and leaves all differ only in their tree type.
# Usually you would have to create the aliases 'birch wood', 'birch sapling', 'redwood wood', 'redwood sapling' etc.
# But this can be shortened by using variations:
#	{tree type}: # name of the variation
#		regular = :0 # list values here. these have the same syntax as aliases, i.e. they can have ids and data/data ranges,
#		redwood = :1 # but you usally only need the data, which is done by typing a colon with no id in front of it.
#		birch = :2
#	{tree type} wood = 17           # this is resolved to: wood = 17, regular wood = 17:0, redwood wood = 17:1 and birch wood = 17:2
#	sapling of {tree type} tree = 6 # you can put a variation anywhere in an alias, it doesn't need to be at the beginning.
#	{tree type} leaves = 18
#
# please note that 'wood = 17' is also resolved for '{tree type} wood = 17'. This is usually what you want.
# This does not work with variations where ids are varied and not only data values. There you
# have to add a '{default}' to the variation, which is treated like all other values in the variation
# but without adding its name to the alias. For examples see 'huge mushrooms' or 'doors'.
# If you don't want a default value, use '{default} = #-#'. See {fish} for an example.
#
# If an item has a block with a different ID you should add another two aliases called 'x item' and 'x block', e.g.
#	cauldron block = 118
#	cauldron item = 380
#	cauldron = 118, 380
# This way if you 'give a cauldron to the player' the player will not actually be given the items of the 'cauldron' alias,
# but the items of the 'cauldron item' alias, causing the player to always recieve the correct cauldron item.
# The same applies to setting blocks, though it usually doesn't matter as items are ignored when setting blocks.
# It does matter for e.g. water though:
#	water = 8, 9
#	water block = 9
# The 'water block' alias only lists the water source block, while the 'water' alias also lists the flowing water block.
# Setting a block to 'water' will thus always place a water source, while checking 'block is water' will work for both
# stationary and flowing water blocks.
#
# If you want to use something else than 'item' and 'block', simply modify the options below:
# 

# optional suffixes  that can be appended to an alias's name and Skript will still understand it,
# e.g. if you only define an alias 'cake', this will allow users to use 'cake block' and 'cake item' as well.
# These are also used to determine the block and item variants of an alias (see above) And should include singular and plural.
item = item¦s
block = block¦s




# List of alias groups. Only groups listed here are allowed below,
# but you can easily define your own by adding it to this list.
# The groups will be loaded in this order,
# e.g. if 'custom aliases' is loaded after 'default aliases' you can use all default aliases to define your own aliases.
aliases = default aliases, collections, custom aliases





custom aliases:
	# === Custom Aliases ===
	# I recommend putting your own aliases here.
	# You do not have to create an alias if you intend to use it in only one script,
	# but you can put it at the beginning of the script like this:
	# 	aliases:
	# 		admin blocks = bedrock, TNT, 52, 56
	# 		wand = blaze rod
	# This also has the advantage that your script can be used by other people without having to add the aliases to their config.
	#
	#
	# If you want to edit a default alias, you should copy & paste it here to edit it.
	# This will make it easier for you if you choose to update Minecraft and more blocks & items are added, in which case
	# you can then simply download the updated config and copy & paste this section into it.
	#
	# The default aliases are loaded before these, so you can use them here.
	# You can also override them by creating an alias with the same name.

	#example: shorten names
	# ss = sandstone
	# llb = lapis lazuli block
	# ms = monster spawner
	#etc.

collections:
	# === Collections ===

	# all ores
	ore¦s = coal ore, iron ore, gold ore, diamond ore, lapis ore, any redstone ore

	fuel¦s = lava bucket, blaze rod, any coal, planks, log, huge mushroom, workbench, fence, wooden stairs, trapdoor, sapling, stick, chest, locked chest, jukebox, note block
	# note: the above aliases are used in 'furnace automatisation.cfg'

	something @- = :
	everything @- = * # '*' is actually the same as 'every :', but 'every' can't be used in aliases. Thus I made this small hack
	                  # to allow the definition of an 'everything' alias, but please note that '*' cannot be used anywhere else.
